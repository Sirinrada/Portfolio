## SUMMARY

A highly motivated and detail-oriented professional with a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Thammasat University, specializing in business analysis and data analytics. I possess a strong foundation in translating complex business requirements into structured data insights and comprehensive system documentation.

My experience includes academic research (presented at ICASD 2023), teaching roles, and several data-focused projects such as customer segmentation (RFM), sales forecasting, and personality classification using natural language processing. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Power BI, and R, and skilled in designing systems using tools such as DFDs, ER diagrams, and BPMN.

With a strong ability to communicate across technical and non-technical stakeholders, I aim to contribute to data-driven decision-making and digital transformation initiatives within forward-thinking organizations. I am currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my expertise to deliver meaningful insights and improve operational efficiency.
